Subject: Request for C# Developers to Enhance HealthTrack System

Dear Developers,
I am working on HealthTrack, a comprehensive hospital management system designed to streamline patient and doctor management, appointments, billing, and more. The current code includes basic functionalities such as adding, updating, deleting, and displaying records. I am seeking skilled C# developers to help expand and enhance the existing codebase by adding new features, optimizing performance, and ensuring robust error handling.
Your expertise would be invaluable in making HealthTrack a more efficient and user-friendly solution for healthcare management. If you are interested, please let me know, and I will provide further details.

Thank you,
